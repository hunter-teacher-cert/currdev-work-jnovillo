# Assignment 00: Standards

### Jessica Novillo Argudo

### SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

#### Directions:
* Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
* You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

## Standard 1

### 9-12.CT.3: Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.

**Assignment addressing the standard:**

Students would be given a data set with much information, for example, the Census data. Students would be asked to choose the five fields they want to visualize on a chart. Students would have to filter and clean the data and to clean the data, choose a learned tool to visualize the data (any type of chart), and they can define the period for the information that will be shown on their charts.

**How does the assignment address the standard?**

The assignment allows the students to work with a large data set as the Census. That data set has much information, so students have to define the best-learned tool that allows them to work more efficiently in terms of processing time and resources. Students would also practice filtering, cleaning, and refining the data. Moreover, through the charts they create, they can easily visualize different types of information, which will help them analyze the data by making comparisons or showing relationships between the charts.

## Standard 2

### 9-12.CT.6 Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

**Lesson addressing the standard:**

A lesson on search algorithms addresses this standard. The teacher focus the lesson on explaining how linear and binary search work. Then the students implement the algorithms in the programming language they are learning. After that, the students can run multiple tests to compare and analyze the efficience of both algorithms.

**How does the lesson address the standard?**

By understanding and implementing the two searching algorithms: linear and binary, the students are targeting the focus of the standard wich is to demostrate how two or more computer science algorithm works. Also by testing the algorithms, students can observe the processing time and memory use to analyze those observations determine which one is more efficient which is a purpose of this standard too.
