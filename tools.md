Please note: I am a master's student. I do not work in a classroom yet. The following tools are the ones I would like to use when I become a teacher.

## Tool 1: Programming/Collaboration tool

### Name
Replit

### General purpose
Allow to write and run code in a browser. It allows multiplayer so that many collaborators can work on the same file at the same time.

### Classes that use it
Any class that involves programming, such as Intro to CS, AP CSP, and AP CSA.

### How would I use it in class?
It can be used when students work independently on any activity that requires programming. Moreover, it would be beneficial when students work on group projects because they all can collaborate and participate in the development of their projects. 

### Why have you selected that tool for that purpose?
I selected this tool because it is easy to use. Students can run code live in their browsers without installing any computer software. Also, real-time collaboration is a great advantage for students to have them all participate in projects.

## Tool 2: Communication tool

### Name
Google Classroom

### General purpose
It facilitates communication with students, organizes class material, and posts assignments.

### Classes that use it
It could be used in any class.

### How would I use it in class?
I would upload the materials and assignments needed for the lessons. Students would have the material available before class to review and be more prepared in class. Having the assignment on google classroom would help me to keep a record.

Also, I would use this tool to send announcements and communicate with students.

### Why have you selected that tool for that purpose?
I selected this tool because it is free, easy to use, and can be used on mobile devices.
