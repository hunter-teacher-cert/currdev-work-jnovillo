### Jessica Novillo Argudo

### SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

#### Directions:
* Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
* Answer the following prompts:
  * What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
  * What is the language?
  * How does one write & run code in this language?
  * Rate the complexity of the syntax?
  * Strengths
  * How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
  * Weaknesses
  * How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
  * Why did you select this language for this class?
___
  
**What is the course? (grade level, student experience)**

**Course:** Web Development
**Grades:** 9th - 12th
**Student experience:** Block-based or text-based programming

**What is the language?**

Javascript: Interpreted and object-based programming language.

**How does one write & run code in this language?**

JavaScript code could be written on a simple text editor or a special code editor, and it is also possible to write in a browser console. 

JavaScript could run on a computer’s terminal having Node.js installed in the system, which is a platform that executes JavaScript code. The JS code also runs in a browser console.

**Rate the complexity of the syntax?**

I would say the syntax is not complex. In my opinion, it is easy to write, read and understand the code.

**Strengths**

It does not require compiling the code before running, which makes execution faster.
It works in any browser, so it is easy to edit and test the code there.
It is mainly used from frontend. However, recently, it has been used for backend as well.
Easy syntax.

**How would you utilize the strengths in the class?**

I would utilize the strength of Javascript to teach students how to create interactive websites using JavaScript and HTML easily and simply. For instance, the ability to write, execute and test code in the browser could speed the ’development of projects.

**Weaknesses**

JavaScript code is interpreted differently in different browsers.
Any user can access the code because it is executed on the client site, and it could be used for malicious purposes.

**How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?**

I would have all students use the same browser so we all can be on the same page and have the same results. I would also warn students that their JS code is visible to anyone and advise them to always take precautions with the information they use in their JS codes.

**Why did you select this language for this class?**

I selected this language because it is one of the most popular languages used on websites. As the course I am focusing on is Web Development, I think JS should be taught to help students develop their projects making their webpages interactive and friendly for users.
