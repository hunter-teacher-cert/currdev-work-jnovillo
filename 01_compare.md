# Assignment 01: Compare

### Jessica Novillo Argudo

### SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

#### Directions:
* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

#### Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.
---

The two APCSP curricula I will compare are [CodeHS - Python](https://codehs.com/uploads/f40041ef134075e10ee0106a0861abe1) and [CS Matters](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/currdev-work-jnovillo/blob/main/CSMattersAuthorized%20Syllabus1652947v3.pdf). I chose those because they both use Python, and I think this programming language is simple and easy to understand, making it a great tool in the educational field.

### Major differences

* Both curricula integrate all the APCSP big ideas: creative development, algorithms and programming, data, computing systems and networks, and the impact of computing. However, the main focus of CS Matters is data. It covers data acquisition, manipulation of large data sets, and data visualization. In contrast, the CodeHS-Python approach is broader.

* CodeHS's first unit focuses on programming to allow students to create computational artifacts, while CS Matters focuses on the effect of data in the real world.

* The order and the regroup of big ideas under the units are very different between these two curricula.


### Major similarities

* They use Python as a programming language.
* They analyze the impact of computing in the world.
* They focus on teaching the big ideas of the conceptual framework defined by the college board.


### Comparative strengths and weaknesses

* One strength of CodeHS over CS Matters is the content organization. CodeHS splits its content into more units than CS Matters. This helps to distribute the big ideas of the course in a more efficient way that can benefit the teacher to effectively focus on specific learning objectives, which will also benefit the students' learning.

* Another advantage of CodeHS over CS Matters is its free web-based IDE.

### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

I am a master's student, and I do not work in a classroom yet. In a scenario where I would have the opportunity to choose a curriculum, I would go for CodeHS Python over the one from CS Matters because it is well-defined, and the content organization is more efficient, which is better for students during the whole year.
