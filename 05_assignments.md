# Assignment 05: Assignments

### Jessica Novillo Argudo

### SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

#### Directions:
* Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan.
* Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file. Save this file in your own personal work repository.
* This is individual work, that can be incorperated into your unit plan later.

## Assignment 1: Final Project - Card game in Python

### Type of assigment

Summative

### Description

At the end of the unit "Intro to Python", students will work individually on a card game where they can demonstrate their knowledge and skills learned during the unit. 

### Student Facing Instructions

Using all you learned during our Python unit, you will develop a simple program to play a card game.

The following are the directions for the game:

* Choose a great name for your game.
* This game is going to interact with the user. The user can play the game more than one time. At the end, the program reports the user's average score.

Rules of the game:

* A deck of cards is shuffled, and one card is dealt from the deck and shown to the user.
* The user predicts whether the next card from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. If the user predicts correctly, the next card from the deck becomes the current card, and the user makes another prediction. This continues until the user makes an incorrect prediction.
* The number of correct predictions is the user's score.

## Assignment 2: Classwork - Conditionals Practice

### Type of assigment

Formative

### Description

In the lesson about conditionals, students will work in pairs (pair programming) on an assignment to practice the correct use of conditionals. This assignment will be considered classwork.

### Student Facing Instructions

**Conditional Mario Kart**

You are going to help Mario to cross the finish line. Mario starts at position 0, and the finish line is at position 20. He is also collecting coins during the race.

Create a program where an element is randomly selected to indicate Mario's actions. This is the list of possible elements ('mushroom', 'koopa troopa', 'banana', 'coin').

If Mario gets a mushroom and has less than 5 coins, he advances 2 positions.
If Mario gets a mushroom and has 5 coins or more, he advances 3 positions and loses 5 of his coins (the minimun coins Mario can have is 0).
If Mario gets a koopa troopa, he does not move and lose all his coins.
If Mario gets a banana, he goes back one position (if possible).
If Mario gets a coin, he advances 1 position and his coins increases by 1.

Your program should run until Mario crosses the finish line (position=20).
