## Assignment 1: Final Project - Card game in Python

### Type of assigment

Summative

### Description

At the end of the unit "Intro to Python", students will work individually on a card game where they can demonstrate their knowledge and skills learned during the unit. 

### Student Facing Instructions

Using all you learned during our Python unit, you will develop a simple program to play a card game.

The following are the directions for the game:

* Choose a great name for your game.
* This game is going to interact with the user. The user can play the game more than one time. At the end, the program reports the user's average score.

Rules of the game:

* A deck of cards is shuffled, and one card is dealt from the deck and shown to the user.
* The user predicts whether the next card from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. If the user predicts correctly, the next card from the deck becomes the current card, and the user makes another prediction. This continues until the user makes an incorrect prediction.
* The number of correct predictions is the user's score.
