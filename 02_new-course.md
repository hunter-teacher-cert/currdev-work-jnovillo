### SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

#### Directions:
* Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
* Make sure to include the following:
  * General description of the course
  * Target audiance
  * Where it fits along with the other courses in your school
___

### Course

I am a master's student, and the course I would like to teach at some point would be Game Design.

### Course Description

Game Design would be a course that focuses on helping students acquire the needed foundations to design and develop games. Students would learn about the Unity environment and how to create 2D and 3D games using the Unity game engine. 

### Target audience

The target audience for this course would be high school, and it could be an elective course.

### Where does it fit along with the other courses in your school?

I do not work in a school yet, but assuming that the school offers an Introduction to Computer Science course, I would say that students who had taken that class could then choose the Game Design course.
